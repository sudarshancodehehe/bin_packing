Bin Packing Optimization Using Quantum Computing

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores solving the Bin Packing Optimization problem using quantum computing techniques. The Bin Packing problem is a combinatorial optimization challenge where items of different sizes must be packed into a minimum number of bins. The implementation leverages quantum algorithms, specifically the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), to efficiently find optimal or near-optimal packing solutions.
